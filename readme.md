Neighbor is an experimental app for exchanging data between phones via P2P framework in the background.
Currently the app works intermittedly using Android's P2P Service Discovery. Different phones and OS versions have different
limitations about the amount of data can be packed into a small service discovery packet, and the only way to specify the amount
seems to be trial and error.

This app has been written and rewritten several times, so the directories with working code are currently 
Neighbor/app/src/main/java/edu/csuchico/ecst/ahorgan/neighbor/
